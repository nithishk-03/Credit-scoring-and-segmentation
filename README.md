This project aims to calculate credit scores for borrowers and segment customers based on their credit scores. The project involves collecting and organizing relevant data about borrowers, such as payment history, credit utilization, credit history, and credit mix. Using complex algorithms and statistical models, the collected data is analyzed to generate credit scores for each borrower

Credit scores are essential for evaluating the creditworthiness of individuals. They help financial institutions make informed lending decisions and offer appropriate financial products to customers. This project provides a systematic approach to calculating credit scores using the FICO score method, a widely adopted credit scoring model in the industry.

To calculate the credit scores, we use the FICO score method, which assigns specific weights to different factors that influence a borrowerâ€™s creditworthiness. The weights are as follows:

Payment History: 35%
Credit Utilization Ratio: 30%
Number of Credit Accounts: 15%
Education Level: 10%
Employment Status: 10%
